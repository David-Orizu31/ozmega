		<h2>$1.537 Billion Mega Millions&nbsp;Jackpot Won by a Single Ticket</h2>

<p>In the lead up to Tuesday night&rsquo;s draw, it wasn&rsquo;t just loyal lottery fans buying tickets for the biggest jackpot in Mega Millions history, everyone and their dog tried their luck at the $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot. The atmosphere was electric as the world held their breath for the draw, and in the end it went to one single ticket holder.</p>

<p>The winning ticket was purchased in KC Mart #7 in Simpsonville, at 303&nbsp;Lee Vaughn Road, and the shop will receive $50,000 as a reward. The owner of the store, Indian-born C.J. Patel, who has run it for 20 years, said that he couldn&rsquo;t believe the news and he hopes the winner will spend the money locally and do some good for the community.</p>

<p>The news came out of the blue in the small town, which is situated just outside of Greenville in the northwest part of the state of South Carolina, and residents are already placing their bets on who the winner could be. However, South Carolina is one of the eight states where winners can choose to remain anonymous, so it&rsquo;s possible we will never know the identity of the biggest lottery winner the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>The winner has 180 days to come forward and claim the huge prize. As per Mega Millions rules, they can choose whether to collect the money in a cash lump sum worth $877.8 million or receive it in 30 yearly instalments, with the single payments increasing by 5% every year.</p>

<p>Lottery officials have advised the winner to put the ticket in a secure location, sign the back of it, and consult with a financial advisor. If you are the winner and you are reading this article, check out our &ldquo;<a href="../what-to-do-when-you-win.html" title="what to do when you win mega millions">What to Do When You Win</a>&rdquo; page for some top tips!</p>

<p>The first estimate had the jackpot at $1.6 billion, which would have been the largest ever for a lottery, but the amount was revised down to $1.537 billion since ticket sales were lower than predicted. The $1.586 billion Powerball jackpot hit on January 2016 by three tickets in California, Florida and Tennessee remains the largest ever awarded by a lottery, but last Tuesday&rsquo;s Mega Millions win is the highest ever won by a single person.</p>

<p>This huge Mega Millions win is also a great news for South Carolina, since the state&rsquo;s taxes on the prize will amount to about $60 million. As S.C. Education Lottery said, this amount will be added to the $10 million derived from the ticket sales and will contribute to fund education programs in the state.</p>

<h2>What Were the Winning Numbers</h2>

<p>The winning numbers from Tuesday 23rd October 2018 were:<br />
28-70-5-62-65 - Megaball 5 - Megaplier 3.</p>

<p>In addition to the record-breaking win, there were 36 tickets matching the five white balls to win the second prize. Eight were sold in California, four in Florida and New York, two in Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey and Virginia, and one in Arizona, Columbia, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>All those tickets are worth $1 million, except for the one in Texas and one in Florida which included the Megaplier, so their prizes increased to $3 million each.<br />

<p>The Mega Millions Jackpot goes back to its initial value of $40 million for the next draw which takes place on Friday.</p>
