	<p>A 20-year-old from Port Richey in Florida has come forward as the winner of the huge Mega Millions jackpot from Friday 5th January. The $451 million top prize was the fourth-largest jackpot ever to have been won on Mega Millions, and the lucky player now has some big plans for the future.</p>

		<p><strong>Positive Mindset</strong></p>

<p>The winner&rsquo;s identity was announced at a press conference at Florida Lottery headquarters in Tallahassee on Friday, just a week after the drawing had taken place. Officials confirmed that the money would be paid into a trust called Secret 007 LLC, and that the managing member was 20-year-old Shane Missler.</p>

<p>Missler had bought his winning Quick Pick ticket at a 7-Eleven located at 7131 Ridge Road in Port Richey, and was not too surprised to find out the result. He had &lsquo;a feeling&rsquo; that it might be his lucky day, and he quickly called his brother to share the news.</p>

<p>&quot;If there is one thing I have learned thus far in my short time on this earth it is that those who maintain a positive mindset and stay true to themselves get rewarded,&quot; Missler said in a statement as he came forward with his father and lawyer.</p>

<p><strong>Plans For The Future</strong></p>

<p>Missler revealed that he had decided to take the one-off lump sum of $281.8 million rather than the full $451 million as an annuity over 29 years, and he is now looking forward to using the money. As well as enjoying himself, Missler wants to take care of his family and do some good in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#39;m only 20, but I hope to use it to pursue a variety of passions, help my family and do some good for humanity,&rdquo; he said, adding that he will also look to move out of Port Richey at some point. Missler also insisted that he had learnt a lot about financial management just in the last week, and was determined to leave a legacy far into the future.</p>

<p>Missler, who would have been too young to buy a ticket in Arizona, Iowa or Louisiana, where the minimum age is 21, became the first Mega Millions jackpot winner since a series of changes were made to the game in October 2017.</p>
