		<h2>The 11<sup>th</sup> largest US Jackpot Win Ever</h2>

<p>Mega Millions fever has been at an all-time high over the last few weeks, with the jackpot rolling over 22 times since the last win on May 4. But last night it was finally won, with someone in California scooping the staggering $522 Million jackpot (cash value of $308 million before taxes).<br />
<strong>UPDATE: the amount was revised to&nbsp;$543 million (cash value of $320.5&nbsp;million).</strong><br />
The winner will have the option to choose whether to collect the win in a lump sum or in 30 annuities.<br />
<br />
The winning ticket was bought at Ernie&#39;s Liquors in South White Road, San Jose.<br />
Kewal Sachdev, the 65-year-old owner of the shop,&nbsp;was at home when an employee phoned him telling the incredible news. Sachdev was astonished!<br />
He said he has run the shop for 18 years and has never seen a win this big. The shop sold close to 4,000 tickets for this draw, which is not that much considering the jackpot amount.<br />
Sachdew&rsquo;s shop will get half a percent of the jackpot won as a reward for selling the winning ticket, which is about $2.6 million.</p>

<p>As stated by California law, the winner will have up to 1 year to claim the prize.</p>

<p>If you are the winner, check out our dedicated guide: <a href="../what-to-do-when-you-win.html"><strong>What to Do When You Win Mega Millions</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The last Mega Millions jackpot win happened on May 4, when the ABC XYZ Trust claimed the $142 million jackpot. Two other massive jackpots were awarded last year: a $451 million prize on January 5 in Florida, and a $533 million prize on March 30 in New Jersey.</p>

<h2>Last Mega Millions Draw Results</h2>

<p>The winning numbers from the Tuesday July 24 Mega Millions draw were: 1-2-4-19-29, Mega Ball 20. The Megaplier was&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s draw was a very generous one: besides the big jackpot win, eight tickets hit the &ldquo;Match 5&rdquo;. Six of them won $1 million and they were sold in Arizona, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota and New Jersey (2). The other two were purchased in Massachusetts and Texas and included the Megaplier option. Their prize was tripled so they won $3 million each.</p>

<p>There were 102 tickets which matched 4 numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the game&rsquo;s 3rd prize of $10,000. Only nine of those included the Megaplier, so their prize was $30,000.</p>

<p>There were a total 3,109,361 winning tickets on Tuesday July 24 at all prize tiers, including the jackpot.<br />

<p>For the next draw on Friday July 27, the Mega Millions jackpot resets to its minimum value of $40 million ($23.6 million cash).</p>
