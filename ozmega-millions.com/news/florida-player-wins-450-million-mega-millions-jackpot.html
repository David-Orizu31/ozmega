	<p>A Florida Mega Millions player became the fourth-biggest winner in the game&rsquo;s history on Friday night when they matched all five main numbers and the Mega Ball to collect $450 million. The lucky ticket holder played their lines at a 7-Eleven in Port Richey, 40 miles north west of Tampa, and now has 180 days to make contact with Florida Lottery officials.</p>

		<p>Winning Mega Millions Numbers</p>

<p>The winning Mega Millions numbers for Friday January 5th were 28, 30, 39, 59 and 70 with Mega Ball 10 and there were nearly three million prize winners on the night. As well as the $450 million jackpot, six players matched all five main numbers to snap up $1 million, while two additional Match 5 winners pocketed $3 million having added Megaplier to their ticket. The Megaplier for the drawing was 3.</p>

<p>You can find the full prize breakdown from the draw at the <a href="../numbers/2018-01-05.html" title="Winning Mega Millions Numbers">Mega Millions Numbers</a> page.</p>

<p>What Happens When You Win Mega Millions?</p>

<p>Friday&rsquo;s winner has yet to make themselves known, and players who purchased tickets in Port Richey, a former home of legendary singers Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, are urged to check them immediately.</p>

<p>If you have matched the full winning line, you should sign the back of the ticket and stow it in a safe, memorable place. Many big winners seek independent financial advice before they claim the prize, as the glare of publicity after a winner is revealed can make it more difficult to keep a level head.</p>

<p>Once you are fully prepared, you must contact Florida Lottery officials at the headquarters in Tallahassee, who will verify your ticket. They will arrange a meeting to go through the paperwork and to issue you with your prize. Your name will be made public by law, but you do not have to speak at a press conference if you do not wish to. Take a look at the <a href="../what-to-do-when-you-win.html" title="After a Mega Millions Jackpot Win">What to Do When You Win</a> page for more information.</p>

<p>Cash vs Annuity</p>

<p>The winner will have to decide how to accept their award; the full amount in 30 payments over 29 years, called an annuity, or a reduced cash lump sum. The cash value of Friday&rsquo;s $450 million Mega Millions jackpot is $281.2 million, which represents the current balance of the prize fund and is the sum the lottery would invest in order to pay out the full $450 million over three decades. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Both methods have pros and cons and the best option for you is entirely down to your personal circumstances. You may think you could invest the cash and receive a higher return than $450 million, but you might also prefer the security of a guaranteed income for 29 years. The <a href="../cash-vs-annuity.html" title="Should I Choose Cash or Annuity? ">Cash vs Annuity</a> page looks at this issue at greater length.</p>

<p>Next Mega Millions Jackpot</p>

<p>Friday&rsquo;s winner was the first since a series of changes were made to the game in October 2017 and the jackpot will now reset to the new minimum level of $40 million. You can buy tickets for Tuesday&rsquo;s drawing at authorized retailers in any participating state. Good luck.</p>
