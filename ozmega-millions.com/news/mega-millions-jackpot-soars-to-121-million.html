		<h2>Latest Mega Millions Results</h2>

<p>Here are the&nbsp;<a href="../numbers/2019-07-09.html" title="July 9 Mega Millions Numbers">winning numbers for the $107 million Mega Millions drawn on Tuesday, July 9</a>:</p>

<p>12-26-40-48-64 &ndash; Mega Ball 01 &ndash; MegaPlier 2x</p>

<p>There were no winners who matched all the 5 main numbers along with the MegaBall to win the staggering prize. There was however, 1 ticket purchased in New Jersey with the Megaplier, which matched 5 numbers and is valued at $2 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="../numbers/2019-07-05.html" title="mega millions draw 5 july">draw on Friday 5th July</a>, with a jackpot of $95 million, was also not hit. The winning numbers were 06-38-47-57-63 with a Mega Ball of 12 and Megaplier 2. There were also no second-prize $1 million tickets which were sold nationally. There were 2 ticket, bought with the Megaplier option, which matched four numbers, and another 9 tickets matching 4 numbers, valued at $500 apiece.</p>

<p>For next Friday, July 13th&rsquo;s draw the prize will be $121 million.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How Many Mega Millions Jackpot Winners We Had So Far in 2019</h2>

<p>On&nbsp;<a href="../numbers/2019-06-07.html" title="June 7 Mega Millions Numbers">June 7th</a>&nbsp;of this year, the $530 million jackpot of the time was won in San Diego matching all 5 numbers including the Mega Ball, but the winner has not yet come forward to claim his ticket. The ticket was purchased at Sorrento Deli-mart, whose owners will receive $1 million as their share of the winnings for having sold the six-number ticket. The winning numbers drawn were 17-19-27-40-68 and the Mega number was 2.</p>

<p>The winner has 1 year from the date of the draw to claim his winnings, as stated by the California Lottery. The jackpot can be received in 30 instalments or at its $345.2 million cash value, but it is in the hands of the ticket owner to decide how it is to be collected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the 4th draw this year with all 6-numbers being matched, the first one being on New Year&rsquo;s day. The&nbsp;<a href="new-york-player-celebrates-new-year-with-a-425-million-mega-millions-jackpot.html" title="jackpot won by 23 co-workers in New Jersey">$437 million jackpot was claimed by a pool of 23 co-workers from Long Island in New Jersey</a>. Two other jackpots were awarded this year. A $273 million jackpot ($162.6 million in cash) was won on March 1st by Michael J. Weirsky in New Jersey while the other win happened a couple of weeks later on March 12th when Hira Singh hit the $50 million jackpot with her ticket being purchased in Kansas City.&nbsp;</p>
