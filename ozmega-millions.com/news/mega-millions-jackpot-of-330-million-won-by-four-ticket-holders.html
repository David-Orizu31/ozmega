		<h2>What do we know about the Mega Millions winners?&nbsp;</h2>

<h3>New Jersey&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Retired couple John and Sandy Belawsky, are the Garden State&rsquo;s newest Mega Millions winners, having landed a share of the $330 million jackpot. The Cape May County couple chose the cash option of approximately $48.6 million before taxes. They bought their ticket at the Blitz&#39;s Villas Market, located in the town of Villas. John, who is a disabled veteran and previously worked in banking and auto finance, commented on the win, saying, &ldquo;It&#39;s amazing what can happen when you stop to pick up a newspaper and a few tickets.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s wife Sandra also previously worked in banking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This recent jackpot win is the second time that a winning ticket has been sold in Cape May County. A ticket worth $390 million was previously sold in Woodbine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Virginia</h3>

<p>Brothers, Bernard and Tucker Adcock from Virginia, were the second players to hold a winning Mega Millions ticket for the drawing on August 31st. The brothers decided to accept the full value of the jackpot, paid out over 26 years, rather than the reduced cash lump-sum. They will receive approximately $3.17 million annually and they bought the winning ticket from Duck&#39;s Corner Good &amp; Gas, located in Buckingham.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;They deserve it as much as anybody&quot; commented one of their friends. The brothers, who are both in their 50s, have enjoyed eating a lot of steak since finding about their new fortune. They have not mentioned what they will spend the rest of the winnings on, but aren&rsquo;t planning to spend a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Maryland</h3>

<p>Ellwood Bartlett of Maryland is the next player to scoop a portion of the $330 million jackpot prize. Ellwood was on his way to teach a Wicca and Reiki class with his wife Denise when they decided to pick up two Mega Millions Quick Pick tickets at a liquor store.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having found out about his win, Ellwood admitted that winning the Mega Millions jackpot wouldn&rsquo;t change him, as he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to live my life like I have been&rdquo;. Ellwood has not confirmed if he will be taking the cash lump-sum or annuity option.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Texas&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The final Mega Millions jackpot winner to share a slice of the prize was SB Alchemy Holdings Ltd of Dallas, Texas. They claimed a quarter of the prize which amounted to $82.5 million. The winning ticket was bought at Krogers, located on 19300 West Lake Houston Parkway in Humble. The winner has not spoken out publicly about the win and a spokesperson representing the winner said, &ldquo;The winner was in San Antonio to enjoy the Riverwalk and to celebrate receiving the prize&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
