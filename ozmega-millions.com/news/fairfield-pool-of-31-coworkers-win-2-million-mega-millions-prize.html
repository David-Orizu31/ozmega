		<h2>Team Work Makes The Dream Work</h2>

<p>Karen Cross from Trumbull, Connecticut, who is employed by William Raveis Real Estate in Fairfield, started a &ldquo;lottery club&rdquo; six years ago with 30 colleagues. Ever since, she has been personally collecting the money, buying the tickets and checking the numbers after every draw.</p>

<p>Finally, the group was rewarded with a $2 million prize on the August 24th Mega Millions draw. Last Wednesday, Karen and several other co-workers travelled to Connecticut Lottery Headquarters in Rocky Hill to claim the $2 million prize on behalf of all 31 members of the &ldquo;Lottery Club&rdquo;.</p>

<p>On that lucky night Karen checked the numbers and found out that one of the tickets she bought matched 5 numbers, but at first she thought they had won just $5,000. A few hours after the draw, Karen learned that a $2 million winning Mega Millions ticket was sold in Connecticut. But later, when she found out the ticket was sold at the Wheels Convenience Store in Fairfield (the same where she last purchased the pool&rsquo;s tickets), her heart started racing.</p>

<p>She drove to the shop together with a colleague to have their ticket checked, while two other members of the group were connected live via Facetime. When the congratulatory message &ldquo;Winner $2,000,000&rdquo; popped up from the Ticket Checker they could hardly contain their excitement.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;We stayed quiet and held it together in the store - we got goosebumps, but when we got inside the car we both just started screaming.&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The winning ticket was a &ldquo;Quick Pick&rdquo; which included the Megaplier option, that&rsquo;s why the $1,000,000 prize was doubled to $2,000,000 (the Megaplier for that draw was 2x).<br />
These were the winning numbers drawn on August 24, 2018: 1-6-13-18-49 - Mega Ball 8 - Megaplier 2.</p>

<p>Since the prize must be divided in equal sums amongst the winners, each of the 31 co-workers will get &nbsp;$64,516.13 (before taxes). The Wheels Convenience Store, located in Post Road in Fairfield, will receive a $2,500 bonus from the Connecticut Lottery for selling the winning ticket.</p>

<h2>Mega Millions Jackpot Goes up to $227 Million</h2>

<p>Here are the numbers from the latest <a href="../numbers/2018-09-11.html" title="Latest Mega Millions Numbers">Mega Millions draw of Tuesday, September 11th</a>:<br />
62-51-15-30-67 - Megaball 19 - Megaplier 2x</p>

<p>There were no tickets matching the &ldquo;5 <strong>+&nbsp;</strong>Megaball&rdquo; and neither the &ldquo;5&rdquo;. The highest prize of the draw was won by 18 players who matched 4 numbers plus the Megaball to win $10,000, while 51 players hit a $1,000.00 win with the &ldquo;Match 4&rdquo; and the Megaplier option included.</p>

<p>The Mega Millions jackpot for the next draw will be $227 million (cash option: $134 million), which is currently the largest among all the lotteries worldwide.</p>
